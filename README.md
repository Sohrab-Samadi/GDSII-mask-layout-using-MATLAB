This reciprocity is dedicated to creating GDSII layouts using Raith_GDSII MATLAB Toolbox. Link: https://raith-gdsii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
To be able to run the codes, you need to put Raith_element.m, Raith_structure.m, Raith_library.m, and Raith_positionlist.m into a folder on your MATLAB path. You can find them on RAITH_GDSII github at [ https://github.com/ahryciw/Raith_GDSII/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/ahryciw/Raith_GDSII.git)



This reciprocity is for greating GDSII layout of complete photonic circuits, which includes grating couplers, waveguides, bends, and tapered waveguides.
The below schematic is the created GDSII layout:
